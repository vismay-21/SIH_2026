Established the SIH 2026 repository baseline with the Flutter application inside `mobile_app/`, while reserving root-level `backend/` and `docs/` directories. Created the initial frontend structure under `mobile_app/lib/`, keeping `main.dart` in its standard location and assigning separate folders to Customer and Worker navigation destinations.

Added the simple Splash, Role Selection, Customer, and Worker placeholder screens. Implemented navigation for role selection, registration returning to the relevant login screen, login leading to the relevant main screen, and four bottom-navigation destinations with Home selected by default. Updated widget tests for both role flows and verified `flutter analyze`, three passing `flutter test` tests, and `flutter run -d chrome`. No backend functionality, real authentication, APIs, database logic, algorithms, or additional dependencies were added.
